(This fork follows from an attempt to try SnaKt with Kotlin 2.4.20.
It consists of quick and dirty changes. It may serve as an indication
of necessary work, but is not intended to be used directly. The original README follows.)

# SnaKt: Kotlin Formal Verification Plugin

[SnaKt](https://github.com/jesyspa/SnaKt) is a plugin for `kotlinc`
that performs formal verification of Kotlin code by translating it to
[Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html).

The plugin is still in early development and large parts of Kotlin
syntax are not supported.

## Structure

This repository consists of three published parts:

- `formver.compiler-plugin`: a K2 compiler plugin that performs formal verification.
- `formver.gradle-plugin`: a Gradle plugin that loads the compiler plugin.
- `formver.annotations`: definitions that are used for adding specifications
  to your code.

Additionally, `formver.common` contains some code shared between these parts.

At present, we do not distribute any part of the plugin through a central repository.
If you would like to use the plugin, clone it and use the `publishToMavenLocal`
task to put it in your local repository.

## Running the plugin

Once you've published to your local Maven repository, you can use the Gradle
plugin to enable verification of your project.
You can see an example setup at [jesyspa/snakt-usage-example](https://github.com/jesyspa/snakt-usage-example).

### Setup

In your `settings.gradle.kts`, configure your Gradle plugin repositories to allow local plugins:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
    }
}
```

Then in `build.gradle.kts`, enable the plugin. Make sure that you also enable the Maven
local repository here: it's necessary to find the compiler plugin for the plugin.

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.3.0"
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.formver") version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()
}
```

Additionally, increase the stack size and metaspace of the Kotlin Daemon: the shaded plugin
jar bundles Silicon and the Scala runtime (~100 MB), and without a larger metaspace the daemon
dies with `OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace` after roughly a dozen compiles.

```kotlin
kotlin {
    // Set stack size to 30mb and raise the metaspace limit
    kotlinDaemonJvmArgs = listOf("-Xss30m", "-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g")
}
```

### Plugin configuration

Plugin options can be enabled using the `formver` configuration block:

```kotlin
formver {
    logLevel("full_viper_dump")
}
```

However, keep in mind that the Viper is dump is provided as an info message: this message will not be shown
unless you run `gradle` with the `--info` flag.

### Annotations

The plugin provides a number of annotations to add specifications to your code.
Applying the Gradle plugin automatically adds a dependency on `formver.annotations`.

### Running from the command line

To execute the plugin directly, build the plugin and then
specify the plugin `.jar` with `-Xplugin=`:

```sh
kotlinc -language-version 2.0 -Xplugin=path-to-plugin.jar myfile.kt
```

The plugin accepts a number of command line options which can be passed via
`-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlin.formver:OPTION=SETTING`:

- Option `log_level`: permitted values `only_warnings`, `short_viper_dump`, `full_viper_dump` (default:
  `only_warnings`).
- Option `error_style`: permitted values `user_friendly`, `original_viper` and `both` (default: `user_friendly`).
- Options `conversion_targets_selection` and `verification_targets_selection`: permitted values `no_targets`,
  `targets_with_contract`, `all_targets` (default: `targets_with_contract`).
- Option `unsupported_feature_behaviour`: permitted values `throw_exception`, `assume_unreachable` (default:
  `throw_exception`).

### Z3

The plugin relies on the SMT solver Z3 which needs to be installed manually.
To do so, download v4.8.7 from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/tag/z3-4.8.7).

Viper gives two ways of interfacing with Z3: text-based (using the `z3` binary)
or via the API (using a `.jar`).
At the moment we use the text-based interface, meaning you need to:

- Install the `z3` binary in your path
- Set the `Z3_EXE` environment variable correctly.

One way to do this is as follows:

```bash
export Z3_EXE=/usr/bin/z3 # or a different directory in $PATH
sudo cp z3-4.8.7-*/bin/z3 $Z3_EXE
echo "export Z3_EXE=$Z3_EXE" >> ~/.profile
```

Make sure that running `$Z3_EXE --version` gives `Z3 version 4.8.7`.
Check that this is the case when you open a new shell, too!
You need to (additionally) set `Z3_EXE` in `~/.xprofile` and/or
`~/.bash_profile` depending on your shell, window manager, display
manager, operating system, etc.

The Gradle and Kotlin daemons capture `Z3_EXE` at startup, so changing it
afterwards has no effect until both are stopped (`./gradlew --stop`, plus
killing the Kotlin daemon).
